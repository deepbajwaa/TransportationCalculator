# TransportationCalculator
This program was written in Java. This program allows a user to enter a distance in kilometers, and it will help them select the best 
mode of transportation based on the distance entered. It has a vareity of options of transportation methods some of which are only local 
to Brampton, ON. In this program I utilized many concepts including class hierarchies, methods, files, graphical user interfaces, and
object oriented programming.
